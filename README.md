# A CBT Quiz Platform

This repository contains the codebase for a functional Computer-Based Test (CBT) platform. As a data scientist, this project was an exercise in applying core analytical and problem-solving skills to a full-stack development challenge, demonstrating versatility and a strong capacity for learning and logical system design.

### üß† A Data Scientist's Approach

Building this platform was less about mastering a specific web framework and more about a methodical, data-centric approach:

* **Logical Decomposition:** Breaking down complex features (like the continuous timer or user data management) into clean, logical components.
* **Data Modeling:** Designing the Firestore database schema to be efficient and scalable for storing questions, user profiles, and test results.
* **Backend Logic:** Focusing on secure and robust backend functions to handle data flow, authentication, and result processing.

This project is a strong reflection of my ability to transition seamlessly between domains and leverage a problem-solving mindset to tackle new and ambitious challenges.
